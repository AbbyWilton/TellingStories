## Changes made since Part II
**Changes implemented**
1. Streamline colors: I did get rid of one or two colors within the visualizations themselves. I struggled to really find a palette that spoke to me or that I felt really represented the story as a whole. I stuck with green for money and decided to keep a purple tone to the rest of the visualizations. I think this brought some femininity to the overall presentations. 
2. Think more about layout of visualizations and adjust accordingly: I made some changes to the consumer trend graph by grouping the major categories. I left food by itself and then grouped the first four major categories together and the rest of the major categories into another group. This made the graph much simplier and easier to read while focusing on the food aspect. 
3. Change wage visualization to be more persuasive and stick out a bit more: I completely changed this visual. I was not finding one within Tableau that was bold enough to make the statement I wanted it to make. I switched over to Flourish Studio and decided to go with donut charts. While they are not always a great visual, I think for this purpose they work. I am able to show the disparity within each specific job from men to women relatively easily and quickly. It shows how much different the wages are without being busy. 
4. Build out the resources page to include more actionable information: I added some detail to the education portion of the take action page. I gathered from the interviews that people were interested but wanted more direction. I added some links to specific pages about specific protections for women in the workplace. 
5. Build out context and add caveats if necessary: One thing I added was two examples of recent law suits brought against companies for gender discrimination. I think this gives valuable context to why the story is still relevant and important over 60 years after some of these laws were put into place. 

## The audience
I really wanted to keep the primary audience as females, and specifically females working in the food and restaurant industry. After talking through some of the interviews, I realized the general public is also a good audience and this does affects
them. To keep both in mind, I increased the number of resources I had listed in the Take Action portion of my story. I wanted to make sure that the education piece was there so that women knew all they could to better arm themselves and protect
themselves in the workplace. I also wanted to ensure I had enough information to create a complete story, but also that the readers knew where to continue researching if they wanted to.

I think for the general public, seeing the additonal recent law suits helps to solidify the fact that this is still an issue. It gives more than just the data to show that even though we have implemented laws and practices to protect women,
 it is not always the whole answer. For women, seeing the numbers helps to solidify what we already see and know to be true. Seeing that there are still people fighting for equal pay at all levels of work is empowering. For both, being given
 the resources to educate themselves on the matter and better learn how to help close the gender wage gap is extremely important. 

## Final design decisions
There were a few specific design decisions I made throughout the process. The first was the overall theme of the photos. They are all food focused, but more importantly, they all tend to the story. The take action photo is full of lots of different people
all spending time together and talking. This helps to immediately focus the attention to the topic of taking action and doing it with people. The photo to introduce the gender breakdown section is a variety of citrus. While this may not seem intentional,
the idea of a lot of different colors and sizes of citrus helps lend to the idea of the differences in gender within the same faily/industry. The data picture is a pie with a slice out. This is a simple and classical take on using an actual pie to show data but also
driving forward the food and restaurant theme. 

Another design choice was color. I struggled with this one a little bit. I did not know what I wanted my color theme to be, and with food there was not one normal or often used color pallete. I knew I did not want to stick with traditional pinks and blues
to represent gender. I tried to keep a narrow color scheme, while also keeping it sort of soft and feminine in tone. I went with green to signifiy anytime there was only money involved on a chart and used it on the consumer spending and age breakdown 
visualizations. Then, I used purple for the base of all of the other charts. It is an easily read color and I think the gradient is effective in showing different hues well. For the last visual, I wanted the colors to really contrast. This is why I 
chose an orange for the male portion, still using purple for the female portion.

## Final Thoughts
While none of the data I saw was surprising, I am still interested in looking further into each state. I think seeing the connection between the wage gap in each state and the state specific laws and protections would be insightful.
One of my interviewees brought to my attention that maybe in some states the cost of living has an effect on the overall population and thus how many men/women work in each job. Again, this level of detail in the data
may exist and I would be interested to look into those specifications. I learned there are a lot of ways to look at all of this data, and there are definitely some ways to misconstrude it to fit a story, but at the end of the day
the fact remains that women are still making less.
