This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University.

## About me
I am a current MISM-BIDA student set to graduate in May. I will continue working for the US Army following the completion of this program. Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my family, cooking, exploring nature, and going to concerts.

## What I hope to learn 
I think that data visualizations and efficiently telling their stories is an often overlooked part of data analysis. Yet, it can be one of the most important. If we are unable to efficicently and accurately convey information, then it does no good. That is what I hope to get out of this class, the ability to better tell stories using the data I am given. I hope to be able to have the tools to make more informed choices about what visualizations to use in different context and the tools to better explain the stories that the data tells.
