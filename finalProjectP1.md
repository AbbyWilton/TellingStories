# Part I: Outline and Data Definiton
## Why a Story about the Food Industry?
The wage gap between men and women in the United States has been talked about for years. However, it is often spoken about in the context of managerial and executive positions. We often fail to notice or care about the wage gap at the middle and starting positions of businesses. The food industry is one that is both saturated with middle and starting positions and is of personal interest to me. I have numerous family members who have worked in the food industry, some for over twenty years. I also find joy in cooking, baking, and experiencing different aspects of the culinary world. I have watched cooking and baking shows for as long as I can remember. It is for these reasons that I want to explore the data surrounding the wage gap within the food industry and bring to light just how deep the gap is.
