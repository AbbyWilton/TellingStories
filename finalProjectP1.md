### Detailed Outline
0. ***Why a Story about the Food Industry?***
The wage gap between men and women in the United States has been talked about for years. However, it is often spoken about in the context of managerial and executive positions. We often fail to notice or care about the wage gap at the middle and starting positions of businesses. The food industry is one that is both saturated with middle and starting positions and is of personal interest to me. I have numerous family members who have worked in the food industry, some for over twenty years. I also find joy in cooking, baking, and experiencing different aspects of the culinary world. I have watched cooking and baking shows for as long as I can remember. It is for these reasons that I want to explore the data surrounding the wage gap within the food industry and bring to light just how deep the gap is.
1. ***What is the food industry?***
From [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/markets/420/topic/494/food-drink-services/#overview), "The food and drink services industry can be broadly defined as the process of preparing, presenting, and serving food and drink to customers. It incorporates many different sectors, including quick service and causal dining restaurants, full service restaurants, cafes and coffee shops, bars, clubs, nightclubs, catering services, canteens, and more." 

2. ***Why should we care?***
There are numerous reasons why the food and restaurant industry is important to us as consumers, voters, and members of the workforce. The first is that as consumers, we interact with the food and restaurant industry very often. This can be in the form of spending money on a nice dinner or grabbing coffee on the way to work. **Visualization about consumer spending trends and some analysis of the trends**. Another reason is that the food and restaurant industry holds **average percentage here** of the jobs throughout the U.S., with **highest and lowest state percentages**. **Visualization showing the percentage of workforce that work in restaurant industry for each state**. 

3. ***So what is the breakdown by gender in the food and restaurant industry?*** **Visualizations depicting the age breakdown by gender and analysis.** **Visualization depicting the occupation breakdown by gender and analysis.**

4. ***What do the laws even say about this?***
This inforgraphic from the [Department of Labour](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WB/508_Equal_Pay_Act_06212023.pdf), explains the timeline of progress we as a nation have made towards equal pay for women. Even though there have been acts and executive orders in place, there are still states without state levvel protection for equal pay and states that do not have pay transparancy. So, what do all the acts and executive orders actually mean? **Explain high level details of Equal Pay Act, Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and maybe the executive orders.**
   
5. ***Okay, and what do the numbers say about it?***
It is important to note that comparisons about gender and age are done at the detailed job level. This means that there is comparable work conditions such as hours worked, location, starting salary and work environment. Analysis does not account for race, ethnicity, or education level. 
***Visualization about gender and wage in most saturated entry/mid level jobs (cooks, wait staff, etc) and analysis.***
***Visualization about gender and wage in most saturated entry/mid level jobs, by state, and analysis.***

6. ***What can we do?***
Call to action here: vote, education **list resources to learn more about the gender wage gap**, self advocacy in your own job **maybe list resources**

## The Data
To begin the story, we need to lay out what the food industry entails and why it matters. To do this, we will define the industry but then we will use data from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables/calendar-year/mean/cu-all-multi-year-2013-2020.pdf) to see how consumer spending in the restaurant and food industry has changed in the last 10 years. This will gie the reader an idea of the size of the industry. We will also see a current status of the demographics pulled from [Restaurant Employee Demographics](https://restaurant.org/getmedia/21a36a65-d5d4-41d0-af5c-737ab545d65a/nra-data-brief-restaurant-employee-demographics-march-2022.pdf) published by the National Restaurant Association.

The bulk of the raw data can be downloaded from [Data USA: Restaurants & Food Services](https://datausa.io/profile/naics/restaurants-food-services?changeOccupation=valueOption&educationWorkforceWage=wage&workforcePyramid=wage). From this data, I will create visualizations that help to tell the story of the wage gap in the restaurant and food industry. I plan to do that through exploring the varying ages that work in the industry, the distribution of job titles, the distribution of gender and education level. From all of this information, I will be able to compile a cohesive story of the differences in pay at various level throughout the industry and their trends throughout the past 5-10 years. 

Additional data on the laws and regulations regarding equal pay will be pulled from [Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/equal-pay-protections). This data will be used as a baseline about what the laws currently are and will help to tell the overall story. In this manner, it will serve as regulations and laws and will be compared against the data to evalutate "adherence" by the industry. The laws and regulations will also be used as part of the presented solution, with discussion on what the average person can do.

It will be used as both background and as part of the call to action. |

## Method and Medium
There is a vast amount of data involved in this project from various sources. In order to keep it organized, data cleaning and preparation will be completed using Tableau Prep. Then, data analysis and visualizations for this project will be done utilzing Tableau Desktop. The story will be compiled and visualized utilizing Shorthand. Throughout the process of creating and refining the story an accompanying visualizations, I will utilize user feedback through surveys and general conversations to determine where changes need to be made.
