# Part I: Outline and Data Definiton
Coffee is something I have been passionate about since I was a little kid, so much so that I got a tattoo of the coffee plant and a coffee cup. It is a staple in my home and something that we always have ready for our guests. It is kind of a joke how much coffee my family drinks and how long I have been drinking coffee (since I was 3 years old). 

I am also passionate about saving money, and realize the importance of doing so in today's economy. With prices continually rising for most goods, it is vital that we be aware of where we can save money while not giving up the nicities we all enjoy. Coffee is one such thing. I want to show the difference in savings that college aged individuals could have if they switched from buying coffee out to simply brewing at home. 

Individuals would be surpised to see that the rise in prices for retailers may not be an exact line to the rise in prices for the consumer. I want to show trends in prices for retailers, and compare these trends to prices for consumers, while also relating this to demand for coffee. Then, I want to explore the cost of brewing at home and how much that could save an individual. Within that, I want to show various savings, from brewing at home once a week to brewing at home everyday.
