# Critique by Redesign

## Part I: Original Visualization
The original visualization can be found in the article *Study: For Full-Time College Faculty, Inflation-Adjusted Salaries Up Only 9.5% Since 1970* at
[Lending Tree](https://www.lendingtree.com/student/historical-faculty-pay-study/#:~:text=The%20average%20salary%20for%20full,had%20only%20risen%20to%20%2488%2C703.).
Approximately halfway down the page is a subsection titled *Faculty salary increases by state, from the District of Columbia to New Mexico*. Here you will find the visualization titled *State look: Where faculty pay has risen the most*, 
this is the original visualilzation I redesigned. 

This visualization is two parts, the first being an interactive map of the United States and the second being an accompanying table of data. I chose to redesign this visualization for a few reasons. 
The first being that have numerous family members involved in the education system and so the pay of professors and educators is a topic that I have a vested interest in. Second, I found this visualization to be good, but not great. 
There are numerous visualizations within the article and most of them are very well done. They are easy to read and require little additional thought by the reader to comprehend and digest. 
However, the particular graph of the United States with accompanying table fell short in comparison. 
I found that the map itself was almost unneccesary and the table could stand alone. But, I wanted to improve the two of these visualization by combining the map chart and table
into one visualiation that told the story of both ranking and the change in salary from 1994-2018. 

## Part II: Initial Critique
For this critique, I followed Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf). I found the following:

**Usefulness: 3.** While there is information within the map visual, the details and important information is in the chart below it. The map itself could be deleted altogether and there would be no loss of information or usefulness. 
The map visual itself has little information, just rankings and percent change in pay. However, this information can only be gleaned via hovering over the state, which makes it impractical for print or static use. 
The visualization statically gives almost no information with the color schemed not defined at all. 

**Completeness: 6.** The map gives ranking and percent change when hovered over. However, it is missing the actual values of pay, what the color scheme means (it is rank but that took some time to figure out), and a time frame.

**Perceptibility: 3.** The color scheme is useful in seeing that there is a difference in something but there is no clear explanation as to what it is saying. 
It is not until you hover over a few states or reference that chart below that you start to see that the visualization color scheme refers to rankings, grouped into sets of 5, and that 1-5 is the best and 45-50 the worst. 
It also has a 51st rating due to inclusion of Washington D.C. but the scale indicated 50 as the highest rating.

**Truthfulness: 9.** There is no wrong or inaccurate data, each state has one color, one ranking and one percent change. 
It also makes the comparison in inflation adjusted values. However, one thing this chart does not necessarily account for is the cost of living in each of these states, and that specific inflation rate, 
and how that has affected the salary change. It accounts for some nuances like that by using percent change. 

**Intuitiveness: 9.** A map of the US is very familiar, and the color scheme fits into what would be naturally viewed as green being positive and red being more negative. 

**Aesthetics: 7.** The visual is not necessarily beautiful, but it is simple, not overly busy, familiar in shape and color and an adequate scale to see easily. 

**Engagement: 5.** I believe this visualization to be truly neutral. It does not distract from the data but also gives no reason to interact with or draw one to the data. 
It allows for simple clicks to interact and see certain groupings of states, but there is little engagement beyond that unless you look at the chart below. 

## Part III & IV: Initial Sketches and User Testing
Following the critique, I realized I wanted to combine the United States map chart of rankings with the table of data below. I wanted to try to show everything in one visualization that was relatively easy
to look at and comprehend. I also wanted it to be able to be printed, so limiting need for interaction such as hovering over states.
I initially started with two initial rough sketches, seen below. The first being a bar chart that would be ranked from highest 2018 salary to lowest. The second being a tree diagram where size of the rectangle would indicate relative
percent change in salary. The bar chart had no colors, but had labels to indicate current salary and percent change. The tree diagram had color to indicate degree of change, with red indicating a loss in salary.
