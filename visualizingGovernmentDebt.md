## Visualizing the changes in Debt to GDP Ratio over time
Below we see the changes in Government Debt to GDP Ratios over time, and how each country ranked overall. The graph shows the top or bottom 10 countries, according to their debt to GDP ratio.

### The data and the charts
  All three above charts used data from the OECD data download site at https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm. We specifically looked at the general governemnt debt as a percentage of the GDP. The first visualization from the OECD website gives a good overview of a single year. It ranks the countries from lowest to highest and allows user to highlight countries of interest. This is useful if only interested in a certain year. The second visualization created on Flourish.studio using the same OECD data shows each country alone and across all years for which it we have data for it. This visualization is able to show trends within a country, but makes it difficult to quickly identify trends across different countries or how they compared within a single year.
  I wanted to combine the first and second visualization to get both rankings and trends. The third visualization, created on Flourish.studio using the same OECD data, allows users to see how countries compared against each other as in the first visualization and how each country changed over time as in the second visualization. It still gives the user the ability to pinpoint specific years by clicking on the timeline, as well as excluding certain countries by clicking on that country in the legend. The interactive nature of the visualization makes it useful in comparing overall trends and seeing how countries moved up or down in their ratio. However, it also makes it difficult to see those trends all together in a static manner like the second visualization does.
