## Wireframes / storyboards
Visit the story in [shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/xvpkBa5g9VhmZBcb).
The story is laid out into 5 sections, separting the sections of the story. The visualizations were done in Tableau. To try and help transition from section to section, I tried to end each section with a question leading the audience to the next section. The general context from the story is similar to the initial detailed outline with some additional information added. 

## User research 

### Target audience
Females who work in the food and restaurant industry are my primary audience. I want to give them the data to be able to represent themselves at job interviews and meetings. The secondary audience is the general voting public. I want to give them information and resources to be able to contribute to change through activism and voting.

To find individuals to interview, I will look for at least two (possibly three) females and two males. Within each group, I want one that is in the food and restaurant industry, and one that is outside of it. This will give me a more holistic viewpoint while still focusing on the primary audience. Luckily, there are numerous individuals in my life who have worked or do work within the restaurant industry, as well as ones who do not and never have.

### Interview script
For each participant, I will follow the same general script as seen below. As each interview develops, I may veer from these questions to enable better flow and get more descriptive answers. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| General Story Understanding     |   What did you learn from the story?               |
| General Story Understanding    |    How did the story make you feel?              |
| General Story Understanding    |    Was anything confusing or unclear in the text/story overall?             |
| Visual Story Understanding    |  Were any of the visualizations confusing? If so, why?                |
| Visual Story Understanding    |  What did you like about the visualizations?               |
| Visual Story Understanding    |  What, if anything, would you change about the visualizations?               |
| Acknowledgement of Way Forward | Do you feel like you are better informed moving forward? |


### Interview findings
Each of the three interviews was conducted via FaceTime. All three were done separately. I gave each user a few minutes to read through the story and then worked through the questions and expanded to get full answers were necessary. The results are summarized below. 

| Questions | Interview 1: 30 year old female, worked as a waitress for 5 years | Interview 2: 35 year old male, worked as a waiter and manager for 10 years | Interview 3: 53 year old male, never worked in a restaurant |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What did you learn from the story?  | I learned that there are more men in management positions and more female waitresses in the food industry |I knew a lot of the information, but not the actual numbers and statistics.  | Women make significantly less than men in food service. I was surprised to see how much and the trend as they age. Also, food service spending is down significantly after pandemic. |
| How did the story make you feel?    | The story made me want to research the issue more.| Neutral  |Frustrated. This disparity should not exist. Even if we account for some contextual variables that might lower the female wage (returning to workforce after home making, etc), the disparity is still far too great |
| Was anything confusing or unclear in the text/story overall?   | Everything made sense except you didn't account for locale. Could it be that the women, in particular, in management positions are located in areas with a lower cost of living and therefore overall wages are less? Are men more likely to be working in cities in NY, CA, FL, etc., where wages tend to be higher to compensate for the cost of living? If that's the case then the wage disparity makes sense and when you account for cost of living differences, it's not that bad. |No, but you did not account for tips. Most females are waitresses and although all tips should be reported, they are not. How would adding tips affect the numbers? Do men get tipped more than women on average? | No |
| Were any of the visualizations confusing? If so, why? |The visualization for gender, occupation, and wage requires you to scroll right in order to see the "Male" column. It's not a huge deal but I was confused at first when I only saw "Female"| No | The graph describing Occupation distribution by gender was hard to follow. The boxes were the same size and differentiated by color. A standard bar graph may have been better.|
| What did you like about the visualizations? | I liked how they were interactive and they weren't all the same.| They were easy to understand.  |The information flowed and built an argument that was easy to follow. the information was easy to disseminate from the graphs and charts |
| What, if anything, would you change about the visualizations? |I would just change the one I mentioned above to display all the data at once. The first chart (Consumer Spending Trends) is too tall to fit on the screen so you can't see the whole graph at once. I think it takes away some of the effects of the graph. The white text against the lemon background is not the easiest to read. | I would change the backgrounds to help the data stick out more and make the colors across the data either consistent or all different. There were some that were green, purple, and blue but only a couple of each color.| See confusing visual question |
| Do you feel like you are better informed moving forward? |I do feel more informed, particularly about the wage difference in management positions. Also, it's interesting to know that most men are cooks and management. Interestingly enough, all the cooks and managers at my restaurant were male.  |Yes| Absolutely |

What I liked about these interviews is that each individual had a slightly different outlook and opinion on the issue, even if they had worked in the restaurant industry. There were some commonalities between all three interviews and others that were different but implementable. 

I did an additonal informal interview in class with 3 females. Their feedback focused primarily on pre-attentive attributes. They suggested that I streamline color throughout the presentation, change some of the layouts of my visualizations, and make text eaily readable. Additionally, since my audience focuses on females in the workplace, a good suggestion I received was to list more in the resources page. 

## Identified changes for Part III

There were some patterns throughout. One was color. The comments were that the colors within the visualizations themselves were to plentiful. Another common comment was about the layout of some of the visualizations, being hard to read or too small, needing to "scroll". One comment I found interesting was that the presentation and data "doesnt account for tips". I do not think it is possible to include that because the tip structure differs so much throughout the industry, but I do think a simple caveat would helpful to make it clear. Another comment mentioned that I did not account for locale. This is a very interesting point that could be explored, if time permits. 

Another thing I gained from the interviews is that I think my final visualizations depicted wage inequalities are weak. I really wanted them to sing and draw peoples attention in, but I think the heat map is too simple. I do not think it makes enough of a statement to really drive home the point about the story. That is a big deal to me, as I want that to be a major point. Although I think readers get that point from the whole story, I want it to be prominent at the end and there to be a stronger reaction to seeing the information. 

**Changes to Implement**
1. Streamline colors
2. Think more about layout of visualizations and adjust accordingly
3. Change wage visualization to be more persuasive and stick out a bit more
4. Build out the resources page to include more actionable information
5. Build out context and add caveats if necessary
6. Find data about cost of living/locale, wages and incorporate it into the presentation

I think most of these changes are reasonable and actionable within a week. They are listed above by ease to do. The last one being the most time intensive. In terms of importance to the story, I think changing the last visualization is most important, followed by adding more resources, then addressing the preattentive attributes. If there is time, I will work on finding more data about specific states and regions to address locale to make the story more well rounded and complete.
