# Part 2: Wireframing and User Feedback
## Wireframes / storyboards
Visit the story in [shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/xvpkBa5g9VhmZBcb).
The story is laid out into 5 sections, separting the sections of the story. The visualizations were done in Tableau. To try and help transition from section to section, I tried to end each section with a question leading the audience to the next section. 

## User research 

### Target audience
Females who work in the food and restaurant industry are my primary audience. I want to give them the data to be able to represent themselves at job interviews and meetings. The secondary audience is the general voting public. I want to give them information and resources to be able to contribute to change through activism and voting.

To find individuals to interview, I will look for at least two (possibly three) females and two males. Within each group, I want one that is in the food and restaurant industry, and one that is outside of it. This will give me a more holistic viewpoint while still focusing on the primary audience. 

### Interview script
For each participant, I will follow the same general script as seen below. As each interview develops, I may veer from these questions to enable better flow and get more descriptive answers. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| General Story Understanding     |   What did you learn from the story?               |
| General Story Understanding    |    How did the story make you feel?              |
| General Story Understanding    |    Was anything confusing or unclear in the text/story overall?             |
| Visual Story Understanding    |  Were any of the visualization confusing? If so, why?                |
| Visual Story Understanding    |  What did you like about the visualizations?               |
| Visual Story Understanding    |  What, if anything, would you change about the visualizations?               |
| Acknowledgement of Way Forward | Do you feel like you are better informed moving forward? |
