# Part 2: Wireframing and User Feedback
## Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

## User research 

### Target audience
Females who work in the food and restaurant industry are my primary audience. I want to give them the data to be able to represent themselves at job interviews and meetings. The secondary audience is the general voting public. I want to give them information and resources to be able to contribute to change through activism and voting.

To find individuals to interview, I will look for at least two (possibly three) females and two males. Within each group, I want one that is in the food and restaurant industry, and one that is outside of it. This will give me a more holistic viewpoint while still focusing on the primary audience. 

### Interview script
For each participant, I will follow the same general script as seen below. As each interview develops, I may veer from these questions to enable better flow and get more descriptive answers. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|      |                  |
|      |                  |
|      |                  |
