The following visualization was created using Flourish Studio. Using data from [King County's site](https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/data/daily-summary.aspx), we plotted the cumulative cases vs the new poitive cases. 
We have options for both logarithmic and linear scales. This gives us different perspectives of the data and shows us how manipulation of the xis can sway the visualization to be presented in differing manners.
